                <h3>Rivers</h3>
                <p class="content">
                There were two major rivers in ancient China: the Yellow River, which is in the Northern part of China, 
                and the Yangtze river which is in the southern part of China. These rivers had major effects on the very early 
                civilizations in ancient China. This is because it allowed them to develop river valleys. Although these rivers 
                mostly benefited the earliest form of their civilization, it continued to provide fertile soil for growing crops, 
                fresh water, and transportation. Even though these rivers did provide helpful things, they also did a lot of 
                damage. One of the negatives in these rivers was that only around 10% of the land was farmable. This is because 
                the rest of the land was covered with deserts and mountains. Also, like rivers in Mesopotamia, the Yellow 
                river would regularly flood. When this happened, many homes and crops were destroyed. This caused the rivers to 
                become an important part of Chinese culture because they were depicted in their art and literature. In fact, 
                the Chinese would actually refer to the Yellow  river as “China’s sorrow”. On the bright side, when the river 
                would flood, it would leave behind silt allowing for a very strong growing season.

                <h3>Mountains</h3>
                <p class="content">
                To the South and Southeast of China are the Himalayan mountains. The Himalayan mountains are the largest mountains in 
                the world and very difficult for people to cross even for us now. Because of this, these mountains provided isolation 
                and natural protection from possible invaders. This was very helpful for the Chinese because they didn’t have to worry 
                about being invaded; they simply had to focus on developing their civilization and surviving. Similar to the rivers, 
                the mountains also affected Chinese culture, as they were an important part of Chinese religion and were thus sacred 
                to the people.

                <h3>Deserts</h3>
                <p class="content">
                To the North and West of China were the Gobi and Taklamakan deserts; two of the world’s largest deserts. Similar to the 
                mountains, these deserts provided natural protection and isolation from other civilizations on the other side of the desert. 
                The only thing was that the Mongols lived in the Gobi Desert. This meant that they would constantly raid cities in Northern 
                China. This meant that the Chinese couldn’t rely only on geographical features to protect themselves from the Mongols. This 
                is one of the reasons that the Great Wall of China was built.

                <h3>How Did These Features Impact the Movement of People and Chinese Culture?</h3>
                <p class="content">
                As stated before, the geography of China caused them to be isolated from a lot of the civilizations in the ancient world. 
                But, how did this impact the movement of their people? Well, for one they had little to now contact with Western civilizations 
                until around 130 BCE when the Silk Road was created. After this trade route was created, people came from the west in order to 
                get large amounts of Chinese items.
                This isolation didn’t only impact the movement of people, but also the culture of ancient China. Unlike other civilizations, 
                China developed independently meaning that they couldn’t take anything from other cultures. Civilizations, like the Romans, 
                took some of their architecture, literature, and philosophy from other civilizations. But, because of China’s isolation, they 
                had to develop their own architecture, literature, and philosophy. This is why there are large noticeable differences between 
                Chinese architecture and Roman, Egyptian, and Greek architecture.
