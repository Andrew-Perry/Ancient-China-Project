                <h3>Rivers</h3>
                There were two major rivers in ancient China: the yellow river which is in the Northern part of China and the 
                Yangtze river which is in the southern part of China. These rivers provided fertile soil for growing crops, fresh 
                water, and transportation. These rivers also had ideological benefits as a lot of their literature and art was based 
                around these rivers. The yellow river was also where the civilization began, being used as a river valley.

                <h3>Mountains</h3>
                To the South and Southeast of China are the Himalayan mountains. These mountains are the highest mountains in the wordld, thus
                providing a nearly impossible to cross border that gave isolation and natural protection 
                from possible invaders. This isolation allowed the Chinese to develop and grow their civilization in peace. The mountains were 
                also an important part of Chinese religion and were thus sacred to the people.

                <h3>Deserts</h3>
                To the North and West of China were the Gobi and Taklamakan deserts; two of the worldâ€™s largest deserts. Similar to the mountains, these deserts 
                provided natural protection and isolation from other civilizations. However, the Mongols lived in the Gobi Desert and would constantly raid cities 
                in Northern China. For this reason, the Great Wall of China was built.
