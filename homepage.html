                Ancient China was a very powerful and impactful civilization in the ancient world. They gave the world 
                silk, gunpowder, and paper. The amount in which they exported these materials gave the Chinese vast amounts 
                of wealth. They also achieved major architectural feats, building the Great Wall of China, 
                the imperial palace, and many temples. The Chinese also had a social structure unlike any other at the time. 
                Rather than basing social status on the level of royalty that a person had, they based it off of what they 
                contributed to China. For example, those who were scholars and gave China knowledge were higher in the social 
                class than the traders and the farmers, even though both of them had the same amount of royalty. Also, China had 
                a political system that gave all power to the single ruler. The rule was passed down through generations making their 
                government a dynasty. Finally, the Ancient Chinese people believed in three different religions that focused on often more
                philosophical subjects than those of gods. Based on all of these characteristics that the Chinese society 
                had, it can easily be determined that they were one of the most powerful and impressive civilizations in the ancient 
                world.
