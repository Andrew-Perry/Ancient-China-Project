                <h3>Xia Dynasty</h3>
                <p class="content">
                The picture shown on the left displays Yu The Great, the founder of the Xia Dynasty. The 
                Xia Dynasty was the first government system to emerge in Ancient China. They set the 
                standard for how the government should work in China’s future. They set in place a 
                dynasty, meaning that leadership is hereditary, and this particular dynasty was founded in 
                1600 B.C.E. and was taken over in 1046 B.C.E. Yu was able to establish his own form of 
                government with him at the head because he helped save the people from a serious flood 
                which earned him a good deal of trust and boosted his reputation. Of course, Yu 
                eventually died and passed the rule onto his son Qi which began the tradition of passing 
                leadership down through the bloodline.

                <h3>Warring States Period</h3>
                <p class="content">
                The Warring States Period was a major political conflict that took place from  481-221 
                BCE. The main reason for this conflict was because many lands broke off of the central 
                government and declared their own independence. During this time, seven different states 
                fought each other for control. A skilled pacifist engineer named Mo Ti shared the war 
                technologies among all seven states hoping that this would prevent any of them from 
                getting the upper hand and thus ending the warring states period, but he failed when Qin 
                defeated Zhao. An influential general in Qin’s army named Sun-Tzu wrote the famous 
                book “The Art of War” during this time period and many claim it was his military 
                reforms that ensured success over the other states.

                Buddhism was founded by the Buddha who lived in India around the sixth century B.C.E. 
                The main goal of Buddhism is personal development and obtaining a deep understanding 
                of the world and having vast sums of knowledge. Buddhists believe in reincarnation and 
                that life is full of suffering and it is impermanent. They believe that the way to find peace 
                is by reaching a state called nirvana which is a joyful state beyond human suffering. 
                Mahayana Buddhism is the more specific type of Buddhism practiced by China. 
                Buddhims became popular because it was similar to Taoism in its practices and beliefs, 
                so people quickly adopted Buddhism. This statue is a buddha statue, which is a depiction
                of the Buddha himself, and can stand for many different things such as peace or meditation.
                People in ancient China often worshiped these statues.

                <h3>White Horse Temple</h3>
                <p class="content">
                The White Horse Temple, as shown on the right, was founded in 68 C.E. It is believed to 
                be the very first temple dedicated to Buddhism. This is important because an emperor 
                helped to establish it, and this caused Buddhism to become widely popular once people 
                saw that their leader supported the creation of the temple. The reason for the name of 
                “White Horse Temple” is because the emperor asked two of his emissaries to search in 
                India for Buddhist scriptures, and they found two monks who rode back with them on 
                white horses, in their honor the Emperor built the White Horse Temple in their honor. 
                Later, many important religious texts were translated into Chinese in this temple giving 
                significant meaning to the people.
