                <h3>Xia Dynasty</h3>
                <p class="content">
                The picture shown on the left displays Yu The Great, the founder of the Xia Dynasty. The 
                Xia Dynasty was the first government system to emerge in Ancient China. They set the 
                standard for how the government should work in China’s future. They set in place a 
                dynasty, meaning that leadership is hereditary, and this particular dynasty was founded in 
                1600 B.C.E. and was taken over in 1046 B.C.E. Yu was able to establish his own form of 
                government with him at the head because he helped save the people from a serious flood 
                which earned him a good deal of trust and boosted his reputation. Of course, Yu 
                eventually died and passed the rule onto his son Qi which began the tradition of passing 
                leadership down through the bloodline.

                <h3>Warring States Period</h3>
                <p class="content">
                The Warring States Period was a major political conflict that took place from  481-221 
                BCE. The main reason for this conflict was because many lands broke off of the central 
                government and declared their own independence. During this time, seven different states 
                fought each other for control. A skilled pacifist engineer named Mo Ti shared the war 
                technologies among all seven states hoping that this would prevent any of them from 
                getting the upper hand and thus ending the warring states period, but he failed when Qin 
                defeated Zhao. An influential general in Qin’s army named Sun-Tzu wrote the famous 
                book “The Art of War” during this time period and many claim it was his military 
                reforms that ensured success over the other states.

                <h3>Tang Dynasty</h3>
                <p class="content">
                The Tang Dynasty is seen as the “Golden Age” of Ancient China taking place from 
                618-907 CE. It is looked back on as an age of reform and cultural advancements which 
                can still be seen in China today. The picture shown on the left depicts a man named 
                emperor Xuanzong who led China to become the most successful country in the world at 
                the time. Significant advancements in science, medicine, technolog, literature and 
                architecture were brought about during this era. One major reason for the prosperity of  
                this time was the reforms that were made for the law and nation as a whole. These 
                reforms were so popular that they were even copied by other nations such as Japan and 
                Korea.

                <h3>White Horse Temple</h3>
                <p class="content">
                The White Horse Temple, as shown on the right, was founded in 68 C.E. It is believed to 
                be the very first temple dedicated to Buddhism. This is important because an emperor 
                helped to establish it, and this caused Buddhism to become widely popular once people 
                saw that their leader supported the creation of the temple. The reason for the name of 
                “White Horse Temple” is because the emperor asked two of his emissaries to search in 
                India for Buddhist scriptures, and they found two monks who rode back with them on 
                white horses, in their honor the Emperor built the White Horse Temple in their honor. 
                Later, many important religious texts were translated into Chinese in this temple giving 
                significant meaning to the people.
