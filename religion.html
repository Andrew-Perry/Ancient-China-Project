                <h3>Confucianism</h3>
                <p class="content">
                Confucianism is closer to a philosophy than a true religion, it was a way of life for the 
                Chinese people. The founder of the belief was a man named Confucius who was a 
                philosopher and political figure who lived during a time period in which Chinese 
                principles began to lose value. He took the morals and values from the old Chinese 
                religions and turned them into social guidelines. Most of his teachings focused on 
                humanism, which includes the age-old rule of treating others how you would like to be 
                treated. Confucianism doesn’t focus on spiritual concerns such as the afterlife, gods, or 
                any sort of magic. Because of this Confucianism is more closely related to philosophy, as 
                it is a mere way of life, not a belief in the intangible. The statue shown on the left is of the founder Confucius.
                He was widely honored for the creation of Confucianism because it gave reason and drive to many people in the time period.

                <p class="content">
                Taoism is an Ancient Chinese religion that came about after Confucianism and was vastly 
                different. In contrast to Confucianism, Taoism focused on the spiritual elements of life, 
                including the nature of the universe. Taoists believe that there is a natural order that 
                works between humans and the world. It is referred to as “The Way” and every person’s 
                goal was to achieve this way. Taoism states that humans need to yield to the Tao, 
                meaning that they only do things that are natural. They also have a concept called wu-wei 
                which means to not strive too hard for personal desires, and instead go with the true 
                nature of the world. The Taoists also believed that one could achieve spiritual immortality 
                by becoming one with nature. The picture shown on the right shows a statue of the founder of
                Taoism, Lao-Tzu.

                <h3>Buddhism</h3>
                <p class="content">
                Buddhism was founded by the Buddha who lived in India around the sixth century BCE. 
                The main goal of Buddhism is personal development and obtaining a deep understanding 
                of the world and having vast sums of knowledge. Buddhists believe in reincarnation and 
                that life is full of suffering and it is impermanent. They believe that the way to find peace 
                is by reaching a state called nirvana which is a joyful state beyond human suffering. 
                Mahayana Buddhism is the more specific type of Buddhism practiced by China. 
                Buddhims became popular because it was similar to Taoism in its practices and beliefs, 
                so people quickly adopted Buddhism. This statue is a buddha statue, which is a depiction
                of the Buddha himself, and can stand for many different things such as peace or meditation.
                People in ancient China often worshiped these statues.

                <h3>White Horse Temple</h3>
                <p class="content">
                The White Horse Temple, as shown on the right, was founded in 68 CE. It is believed to 
                be the very first temple dedicated to Buddhism. This is important because an emperor 
                helped to establish it, and this caused Buddhism to become widely popular once people 
                saw that their leader supported the creation of the temple. The reason for the name of 
                “White Horse Temple” is because the emperor asked two of his emissaries to search in 
                India for Buddhist scriptures, and they found two monks who rode back with them on 
                white horses, in their honor the Emperor built the White Horse Temple in their honor. 
                Later, many important religious texts were translated into Chinese in this temple giving 
                significant meaning to the people.
