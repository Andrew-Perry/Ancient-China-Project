                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p class="content">
                The Ancient Chinese social structure was very set in place. Everybody knew exactly where they were in Chinese society. 
                There were four classes that someone could be in, the shi, nong, gong, or the shang class. These classes were built 
                off of the idea of having four occupations. The job that the man had and the service he gave to the Chinese kingdom 
                would determine the social class that the family was in. While it was possible for people to move between social 
                classes, it rarely ever happened. The only practical way in which somebody could move classes would be to marry into 
                a higher class. The picture on the left shows the status of each social class. At the top was obviously the emperor, 
                while at the bottom was the shang class, or, the merchants.

                <h3>The Shi</h3>
                <p class="content">
                The people in the Shi class were the ruling class of ancient China and were at the top of the social scale. One of the occupations 
                that was in the Shi class were the governors. These governors, or military commanders, held large amounts of power, particularly 
                during the Shang Dynasty. Another kind of job that was in the shi class was the land-owning noble. These people didn’t have power 
                through military strength but rather through inheriting the power and land that came from being in a noble family. The last kind of 
                occupation that made up this class was the scholar. These people spent their lives studying in order to work as bureaucrats in the 
                imperial government. These people didn’t own land yet were still treated with great respect on account of their large amounts of knowledge. 
                The picture on the right shows a meeting of the Chinese people with high status. This demonstrates how important the scholars, govenors, 
                and nobles were in the Chinese society.

            <h3 class="oddcontent">The Nong</h3>

                The people in the Nong class made up the majority of Chinese society. In fact, this group made up around 90% of the population. This class was 
                made up of peasants who lived in small communities spending their time on farms throughout China. Although they lived and worked on these farms, 
                most of the farms were owned by nobles in the Shi class. The reason that these people would work farms that they didn’t own was because in return 
                for their work, they would be given military protection. As a result of the large amounts of farming, this class built the Chinese economy and also 
                paid the most amount of taxes. This picture on the left shows ancient CHinese farmers. From this picture, you can see 
                how many people were in this class.

            <h3 class="evencontent">The Gong</h3>

            <p class="content evencontent">
                Although the Nong class was the peasant class, there were two still two classes lower than that; one of which being the Gong class. This social class 
                was made up of the artisans and craftspeople. These people were armorers, metalworkers, and carpenters. Because of the talent that was required to be 
                in the Gong class, it had very few people in it. Also, because land ownership and agriculture were so important in ancient China, people in the Gong 
                class were treated as inferior to the people in the Nong class. Even though they were treated as inferiors, people in the Nong and Shi class were heavily 
                reliant on the skills that come from this class. The picture on the right shows craftsmen in ancient China. From this picture, 
                you can see the different types of things that these craftspeople would make and how difficult it appears to be.

            <h3 class="oddcontent">The Shang</h3>

                The lowest class in ancient China (aside from the slaves) was the Shang class. These people made up the merchants and traders. 
                The reason that this class was placed lower than all of the other classes is because they didn’t own any land like the Nong class 
                and they didn’t produce any of their own things like the Gong class. Even though this was technically the lowest class in ancient 
                China, these people could become extremely wealthy. One of the ways that they could do this was by lending money to people who 
                were in debt and charging regular payments until they were paid back. Other traders could make lots of money by exporting luxury 
                items such as silk to other kingdoms. The picture on the left shows people in ancient China trading. From this picture, you can see 
                how many people would come to China to trade with these merchants.
