                The Great Wall of China was built as a defensive wall against Northern invaders. 
                Many dynasties made their own walls, the most well known being the wall of the Ming 
                dynasty. These walls helped to defend from not only nomadic invaders but also the Mongols. 
                Although they helped with protection from outside invaders, they were initially built for 
                protection from other Cahinese kingdoms. However,  Shihuangdi, the first emperor of a united China, 
                connected all of these walls forming one large ‘Great Wall’. The picture on the left shows a picture 
                of the Great Wall. From this picture, you can see the large size and impressive style of the Great Wall.

                Silk was perhaps one of the most economically important creations of ancient China. The creation of silk can be traced back to 
                around 2700 BCE in Qianshan Yang, however some archaeological records trace the creation of silk back to around 4000 BCE. Although 
                we don’t know exactly when silk was created we know how it was created. Silk would be made by the Chinese using a thread produced 
                from silk worms that were then woven using a loom. The people who would weave this silk were traditionally women. As China made 
                more and more silk, the quality of their silk improved tremendously. By the time of the Han dynasty, Chinese weavers were capable 
                of making silk with 220 warp threads per centimeter. Because of the high quality of this item, it was traded in large amounts 
                and brought great wealth to China. In fact, this item was so sought after that the Roman empire eventually had an economic downfall 
                because of how much silk they were importing. The picture on the right shows ancient Chinese silk workers. This picture's important 
                because it demonstrates just how much was going on in the silk making process. You can see all of the tools and all of the people 
                necessary in order to make this silk.

                <p class="content oddcontent">
                Gunpowder was invented by the Chinese in around 300 CE however there are reports of Wei Boyang, the “father of alchemy”, 
                documenting a gunpowder like substance that would “fly and dance” in around 142 CE. At first, gunpowder was used for firecrackers 
                rather than weapons. However, the Chinese eventually used this gunpowder to make explosive arrows. These arrows didn't do much damge 
                but did a great job at distracting the enemy. The Mongols later introduced gunpowder to the rest of Europe in around the 1200’s. 
                Europeans would then create guns and cannons that would dominate China until around the 1800’s. The picture on the right shows non-Chinese 
                soldiers using gunpowder in some kind of weapon. This is significant because it demonstrates how the Chinese's invention of gunpowder 
                was later used against them in the form of weapons.

                <h3>Paper</h3>
                <p class="content">
                The Chinese were the first people to create paper. Paper was a really important material because it was cheaper and more convenient 
                than other materials like bamboo, wood, or silk. This new material was used to transcribe literature and was eventually used as the 
                currency of China. At first, people would use bamboo and expensive silk as a surface of writing. However, after the invention of paper,  
                people began to use the cheaper alternative of paper scrolls. Paper is said to be invented in 105 CE by Cai Lun, a director of the 
                imperial workshops at Luoyang. He would create his paper by using soaked and then pressed plant fibers that were then dried on wooden frames.
