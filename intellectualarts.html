                <h3>The Great Wall of China</h3>
                The Great Wall of China was built as a defensive wall against Northern invaders. 
                Many dynasties made their own walls, the most well known being the wall of the Ming 
                dynasty. These walls helped to defend from not only nomadic invaders but also the Mongols. 
                Although they helped with protection from outside invaders, they were initially built for 
                protection from other Chinese kingdoms. However,  Shihuangdi, the first emperor of a united China, 
                connected all of these walls forming one large ‘Great Wall’.

                <h3>Silk</h3>
                The creation of silk can be traced back to around 4000 BCE! For thousands of years, China was the only 
                civilization that had access to silk. They eventually made sophisticated technology in order to weave silk. 
                After the creation of the silk road, China would export this fabric for large amounts of money. Because of how 
                much money this was making them, the technique to create silk was kept a closely guarded secret.

                <h3>Gunpowder</h3>
                Gunpowder was invented by the Chinese in around 300 CE however there are reports of Wei Boyang, the “father of alchemy”, 
                documenting a gunpowder like substance that would “fly and dance” in around 142 CE. At first, gunpowder was used for firecrackers 
                rather than weapons. The Mongols later introduced gunpowder to the rest of Europe in around the 1200’s. Europeans would then 
                create guns and cannons that would dominate China until around the 1800’s.
